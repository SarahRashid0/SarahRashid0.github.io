            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>
                This project investigates whether independent schools in England create educational advantages or simply reflect existing socioeconomic privilege. While independent schools consistently demonstrate superior academic outcomes, the central question examines whether this performance gap represents genuine value-added education or geographic clustering in already-advantaged areas. Through geographic analysis, historical cost trends, academic performance comparisons, and statistical correlation, this research explores the complex relationship between private education, inequality, and opportunity.

                The academic performance advantages translate directly into university access disparities.

                Statistical analysis reveals a moderate positive correlation (r=0.533, p<0.001) between independent school density and state school GCSE performance across London boroughs. This finding suggests that independent schools cluster in areas where state schools are already performing well, indicating that the "private school advantage" may partially reflect broader geographic and socioeconomic factors rather than purely institutional quality.

            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>
                Data was sourced from multiple UK government datasets and historical archives. Independent school locations were obtained from the Department for Education's Get Information About Schools (GIAS) service, providing comprehensive establishment data including coordinates, pupil numbers, and institutional characteristics. Academic performance data (GCSE and A-level results by institution type) came from the DfE's Explore Education Statistics platform, covering years 2019-2025. University progression statistics were accessed through the DfE's Higher Education progression database. Geographic boundary data for mapping utilised ONS Geography Portal shapefiles and London Datastore resources. Historical fee data for the Clarendon Schools was manually compiled from archival sources and adjusted for inflation using Bank of England historical inflation calculators.
            </p>
            <p>
                All data processing was conducted in Python using Google Colab notebooks (accessible at <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13DkU8-WFaqgpJNDRx2WY356Bb0yn3bpX?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this link</a>), with cleaned datasets hosted publicly on GitHub for reproducibility. While initial attempts to automate data collection through the ONS API were explored, direct CSV downloads proved more reliable for this project's scope, ensuring data quality and consistency across multiple years.

            <h2>Tools & Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Data cleaning and analysis were performed using Python (pandas, scipy.stats) within Google Colab environments. Geographic coordinates required transformation from British National Grid to WGS84 latitude/longitude for web mapping compatibility. Historical fee data underwent inflation adjustment using Bank of England multipliers to convert all values to 2025 prices, enabling meaningful temporal comparisons. Statistical correlation analysis employed Pearson's correlation coefficient and ordinary least squares regression through scipy.stats.linregress to quantify the relationship between independent school density and local state school performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visualisations were built using Vega-Lite specifications, chosen for their declarative approach and interactive capabilities. Each chart incorporates interactive elements—dropdown menus for metric selection, temporal sliders, and hover tooltips—to enhance data exploration. The project website is hosted via GitHub Pages, with all visualisation specifications, cleaned datasets, and analytical code publicly accessible in the repository, ensuring full reproducibility and transparency.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key technical challenges included handling missing historical data (some schools lacked complete fee records across all years), managing data type mismatches during borough-level merges (GSS codes vs. numeric LA codes), and optimising map rendering performance with 1,600+ data points. These were addressed through strategic data filtering, explicit type conversions, and layered visualisation approaches that balance detail with performance.

    <!-- CONCLUSIONS Section -->
    <section class="section">
        <div class="container-narrow">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                This analysis reveals that while independent schools demonstrably produce superior academic outcomes—with performance gaps of 20-30 percentage points at GCSE and A-level, and nearly triple the university access rates to elite institutions—these advantages cannot be attributed to school quality alone. The statistically significant positive correlation between independent school concentration and state school performance (r=0.533, R²=0.284, p<0.001) indicates that private schools cluster in already-advantaged geographic areas where state provision is comparatively strong.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer to whether private education creates advantage or reflects it appears to be: both. Independent schools do deliver measurably better examination results and university access, justifying their positioning as high-performing institutions. However, these schools concentrate in wealthy areas with strong local state sectors, suggesting that the "independent school premium" partly represents the purchase of access to advantaged geographic and social networks rather than purely superior pedagogy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, the historical cost analysis demonstrates that elite education is becoming progressively less accessible. Even after inflation adjustment, Clarendon School fees have increased substantially in real terms over 95 years, concentrating access among increasingly narrow socioeconomic bands. Combined with the geographic clustering findings, this suggests that private education simultaneously reflects existing privilege while potentially amplifying inequality through restricted access and concentrated opportunity networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Future research could extend this analysis by examining long-term earnings outcomes, controlling for prior attainment in university access analysis, or investigating whether the geographic correlation holds at finer spatial scales. Additionally, comparative analysis across different types of independent schools (highly selective vs. less selective, day vs. boarding) might reveal whether value-added effects vary by institutional characteristics.
